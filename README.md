**Weather App**

The Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to get weather information for a specific city. It uses the Weather API by API Ninjas to fetch weather data for the specified city.

**Getting Started**

To run the Weather App locally, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites**

You need to have the following installed on your machine:

1. Node.js
2. npm (Node Package Manager)

**Installation**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app
   
Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
npm install

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your API key and API host:
   ```bash
API_KEY=YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY
API_HOST=weather-by-api-ninjas.p.rapidapi.com

Replace YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY with your actual API key from the Weather API by API Ninjas.

**Running the App**

To start the server and run the app, use the following command:
   ```bash
npm start

The server will start running on http://localhost:3000.

**Usage**

1. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
2. Enter the name of the city for which you want to get the weather information.
3. Click the "Get Weather" button.
4. The app will fetch weather data for the specified city and display it on the page.

**Architecture**

The Weather App is built using a server-client architecture.

**Server-side**

The server is implemented using Node.js and Express. It serves static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the client and handles API requests to fetch weather data from the Weather API by API Ninjas.

The server-side code is located in the server.js file. It uses the axios library to make HTTP requests to the external API.


**Client-side**

The client-side is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The client-side code fetches user input, sends requests to the server to get weather data for a specific city, and updates the page with the fetched data.

The client-side code is located in the public/index.html and public/index.js files.

**Deployment**

You can deploy the Weather App to a hosting platform of your choice. Some popular options include:

1.Heroku
2.Netlify
3.Vercel
4.AWS Elastic Beanstalk
5.DigitalOcean
6.Before deploying, make sure to set the environment variables (API_KEY and API_HOST) on the hosting platform to secure your API key.
